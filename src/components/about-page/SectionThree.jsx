              Our Affiliation with Jaflah Software Development Company Jaflah
              Software Development Company is the mother company of Code Geeks
              9ja. This affiliation births the incredible feature that
              differentiates Code Geeks 9ja from other IT institutes in the
              country as it allows our trainees to have direct access to
              production applications coding. As an engineer, there are issues
              that you would only face on production apps. As well, there is a
              limit to what you can learn and experience by building test apps
              locally on your computers. Things can become a little scarier in
              live apps. And so you do not get lost when you face job interviews
              or pushed into a heavy code base, outside our horizons, we give
              you the opportunity to equip yourself and strengthen your
              portfolio with proven live applications. This is priceless and
              will only benefit you greatly as you dive into the ocean of job
              opportunities in the software development world.
